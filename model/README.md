# Endpoints

An endpoint gets marked as completed once it's mapped out and a small test runs in CI.

Please do help out mapping the API! All you need to do is create the necessary struct and quickly implement 2 traits. If you need help, feel free to reach out.
You don't even need to fork this library to test your struct!
